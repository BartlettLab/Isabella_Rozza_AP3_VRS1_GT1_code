# Isabella_Rozza_AP3_VRS1_GT1_code
This is the code that I used in R to analyze my data that I collected from my GT1, VRS1, and YFP Arabidopsis plants. I compared genotypes including and excluding the position the flower was in on the plant (apical vs lateral flower).
I uploaded my data for each factor I was testing: stamen length, stamen number, petal width, and petal length.
I viewed the summary of the data and the p values comparing the factors across genotypes. 
I created box plots to view this data.
I repeated this all and included flower position with genotype.
